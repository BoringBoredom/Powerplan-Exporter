This script exports the current power plan (including all hidden settings) as text file using *powercfg /QH* and then converts it to a bat file. If the text file already exists, exporting is skipped. This makes editing of the text file and direct conversion to a bat file possible.  
Manually change the name and description of the power plan in the bat file after converting.  
Only works with an English Windows version. As workaround you can ask someone with the same Windows version to send you his *PowerplanSettings.txt*
